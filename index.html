    <p>It was nearly about 10 o`clock at morning. The date was 16th August. Sorodindu opened door of the cafe and entered. 
        When he entered he was shocked to see the dead body of his friend Abhishek. </p>
    <p>Within few hour police came and started investigation. The main investigator of this case was Rambabu. Rambabu was the senior investigating officer of Lalbazar police station. But after investigating for almost one day he failed to solve the mistry. 
        At that moment the name of Gora flashed upon his mind. </p>
        <p>Gora the famous detective commonly known as Satyanishi. So Rambabu decided next day morning he will meet with Gora and handover this case.</p>
    <p>It was nearly about 7:30 am. Gora was reading a newspaper, beside him Ajit was sitting and writing something.
        At that moment bell rang.

    </p>
    <p>
        At 10am that day.
        <br><b>Gora:</b>Ajit what do you think from where we should start this case?
        <br><b>Ajit:</b>I think from the murder spot.
        <br><b>Gore:</b>Okey lets go to that cafe.
        <br>Gora and Ajit went to Sorodindu`s cafe.(Sarodindu was the owner of a cafe. He was the childhood friend of Abhishek.)
        <br><b>Gora: </b>What is your name?
        <br><b>Sorodindu:</b>My name is Sorodindu.
        <br><b>Gora:</b>This is your cafe?
        <br><b>Sorodindu:</b>Yes sir this is my cafe.
        <br><b>Ajit:</b>How do you know Ahishek?
        <br><b>Sorodindu:</b>He was my childhood friend.
        <br><b>Gora:</b>If this is your cafe then what he was doing here that night?
        <br><b>Sorodindu:</b>Abhishek was a novel writer. He alaways sits on the window corner table of my cafe and try to write his novel.
        I have given a key of my shop to him so that whenever he wants he can come and go whenever he want. 
        <br><b>Gora: </b>Why he doesnot have anyone in his family?
        <br><b>Sorodindu:</b>Yes he had a wife.
        <br><b>Gora:</b>His wife does not treat him well?
        <br><b>Sorodindu:</b>No his wife was very good to him.
        <br><b>Gora:</b>Can you give me his house address or where i will find his wife.
        <br><b>Sorodindu:</b>Yes yes his wife is in 6thpalace ballyguange rode, house no-25.
        <br><b>Gora:</b> Rambabu will call you, if anything more is needed from you.
</p>
<p>
    <br><b>Ajit:</b>Gora lets go
    <br><b>Gora:</b>Ajit not now first we have to the police sation and check the postmortem reports.
    <br>Gora and Ajit reached to police station
    <br><b>Rambabu:</b>Welcome Gorababu.
    <br><b>Gora:</b> I want to check the postmortem reports. 
    <br><b>Rambabu:</b>Yes yes take it. Nothing has found in this. 
    <br><b>Gora:</b>I see! Okey i want to talk with Abhishek`s wife.
    <br><b>Rambabu:</b> Yes yes let`s go.
</p>
<p>
    <br>Rambabu, Gora and Ajit reached to 6thpalace ballyguange rode, house no-25.
But arriving there, they saw that the house was completely deserted. They thought Abhishkek's wife was not at home. So they were prepared to come back, suddenly Ajit`s eyes fall into a open window.
When they reached near to that window they saw a lady(Abhisekh`s wife) was lying upon the ground and a book upon her chest. That was looking like a dead body.
They broken the gate and Rambabu checked that body and decleared dead.
<br><b>Gora:</b>Send this body for postmortem as soon as possible.
<br><b>Rambabu:</b>Yes yes.
<br><b>Gora:</b>When i will get this postmortem report?
<br><b>Rambabu:</b>Within tomorrow.
<br><b>Gora:</b>Okey then lets meet tomorrow.
</p>
<p>
    <br>Next day 9 o`clock. Phone bell rang.
    <br><b>Ajit:</b>Hello
    <br><b>Rambabu:</b>Yes i have got the reports please come as soon as possible.
    <br><b>Ajit:</b>Comming.
    <br><b>Ajit:</b>Gora Gora...
    <br><b>Gora:</b>What happend?
    <br><b>Ajit:</b>We have to go to the police station the postmortem report has arrived.
    <br><b>Gore:</b> Then why we are wasting time lets go.
</p>
<p>
    <br>Gora and Ajit reached to the police station.
    <br><b>Gore:</b>Rambabu what is written in that report?
    <br><b>Rambabu:</b>Very interesting thing. In the report it is written that she has died due to poison and yesterday
    when forensic department are investigating they haven`t got a single drop of poison in that house.
    <br><b>Ajit:</b>Then from where she got poison?
    <br><b>Gora:</b>Can i get the book which she was reading?
    <br><b>Rambabu:</b>Yes yes take it.
    <br>Gora checked the book carefully.
    <br><b>Gora:</b>Rambabu send this book to test. And within how much time we will get the report?
    <br><b>Rambabu:</b>Within evening.
</p>
<p>
    <br>At 6:18pm phone bell rang. 
    <br><b>Satya:</b>Hello.
    <br><b>Rambabu:</b>I am Rambabu can you please give the phone to Gorababu.
    <br><b>Satya:</b>Yes hold.
    <br><b>Satya:</b>Gora Gora..Rambabu is on the line, he wants you.
    <br><b>Gora:</b>Yes comming.
    <br><b>Gora:</b>Yes Rambabu tell.
    <br><b>Rambabu:</b>You are right the poison was in all the pages of the book.But i has one doubt that wy she was licking the pages of the book?
    <br><b>Gora:</b>No i think she was not licking. Many people have the habit of turn the page with toung saliva.
    <br><b>Rambabu:</b>Yes this is possible. But why someone has mixed the poison with the page i can`t understand?
    <br><b>Gora:</b>That is the main question. I want to go to that house tomorrow again. I think i will get all the answer from there. And i want the cctv footage of that night of the cafe. 
    <br><b>Rambabu:</b> Okey no issue.  
</p>
<p>
    <br>Next day morning at 7 o`clock Gora was observing Abhishek`s house carefully and talked with Abhishek`s father and mother and the neighbours also. Suddenly he realised someone was following him.
    When Gora turned back that person who was following him started running Gora also started chasing him. And finally he caught him. Gora saw that the person was none other than 
    Sorodindu.
</p>
<p>
    <br><b>Gora:</b> called all(Ajit,Satya,Rambabu,Sorodindu,Lily,parents of Abhishek`s wife and other officers who were involved in this case) in a park near to Abhishek`s house at evening that day. 
    <br><b>Gore:</b>All of you present here please listen very carefully what i am going to tell now. Murderer is present here.
    <br><b>Rambabu:</b>I understand who is the murderer from first only i have a doubt on Sorodindu. I am sure he is the murderee.
    <br><b>Gora:</b>Don`t be so excited Rambabu let me finish.
    <br><b>Rambabu:</b>Sorry sorry you tell first.
    <br><b>Gora:</b>While i had cought Sarodindu i came to know from him that 14th August Abhishek with a paint brush and a bottle
    he was drawing something in a book when he was in Sarodindu`s cafe. And i also checked the cctv footage and after carefully obser that for few time i am sure that bottle was the bottle of poison and that book was also same.
    From parent of Abhishek`s wife i come to know that she has the habit of turning the page with saliva of toung.
    Not only that Abhishek was not happy with her wife because Abhishek loves Lily (Lily was the college friend of Abhishek`s wife).
    Abhishek torchur his wife but he doesnot give him devorce because he was passing through a writer-block from last few year and Abhishek1s wife was the only child so he got money from there.
    He thought that if he can remove his wife from the world then he will get all her properties and also can marry Lily. So, he mixed poison with the book and gifted to her wife. But badluck before he can fulfill his dream he passed away.
    <br><b>Ajit,Rambabu:</b>How?
    <br><b>Gora:</b>Lily the rest of the stoy you will tell or i will tell them. Okey let me tell- Lily was the friend of Abhishek`s wife.
    She could not bear her pain. Abhishek many time tried to seduced her also. So, she decide to kill Abhishek. She somehow came to know that Abhishek has heart disease. So, she made a radiofrequency device which generate frequency and interestingly she had given that a shape of sound box.
    From cctv and Sorodindu i came to know that 15th August she was he last customer who came to meet with Abhishek. when she was leaving she kept that device above the sound box of the cafe so that it can produce more frequency. And as a result after 2hrs Abhishek died.
    We all have ignored that device because it was exactly looking like a very small sound box.
<br><b>Ajit:</b>What an innovative idea.
<br><b>Rambabu:</b>Officer arrest her.
<br><b>Gora:</b>My job is finished Rambabu. Goodbye hope to see you in the next case very soon.
